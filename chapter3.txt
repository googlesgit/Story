Your future is written by the choices you make today—not the ones you didn’t make yesterday. Stop waiting for permission to become the person you’ve always wanted to be. Take the leap. Chase the wild idea. Trust your fire. You are capable of more than you know, and the only thing standing between you and extraordinary is the belief that you can. Don’t just survive—build something beautiful with your life. No matter how small the steps, keep walking forward. You’re closer than you think.
