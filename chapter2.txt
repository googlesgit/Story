Greatness isn’t reserved for the chosen few—it’s built by the relentless, the consistent, and the brave. You may feel overwhelmed or uncertain, but remember: even giants were once beginners. You’re allowed to fall, but never to quit. Progress isn't always loud. Sometimes it's the quiet decision to show up again, even when no one sees you. Keep grinding, keep believing. The moment you decide you're not turning back is the moment everything begins to shift.
